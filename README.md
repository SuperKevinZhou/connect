# Connect

Welcome to Connect! This is a project aiming to build a fast, secure, peer-to-peer (P2P), end-to-end-encryption (E2EE) chatting app.

This project is *not* the UI of the app. We only handles services there.

This project is hosted on **Codeberg** with a mirror on GitHub. Although commit sync is enabled, I suggest you open Issues and PRs on **Codeberg**.

We plan to communicate with UI frontend by using RESTful APIs.
